# Oxidized TScript
This will be a Rust interpreter for the [TScript](https://github.com/TGlas/tscript)("teaching-script") programming language.
The Interpreter is supposed to support the full TScript Syntax and behave as close as possible to the [TypeScript reference implementation](https://github.com/TGlas/tscript).
This Interpreter will use the [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) parser for Rust to generate the AST.

# Planned Features
Canvas, Turtle and Audio Playback may be implemented later.
- [TScript Core](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/?doc=/library/core)
- [Script Math](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/?doc=/library/math)

# Planned Targets
This interpreter is supposed to support the following Platforms:
- Linux
- Window
- MacOS
- WebAssembly

# Documentation
This interpreter is supposed to behave the same as the reference implementation.
Because of that you can use the [original documentation](https://tglas.github.io/tscript/?doc=).

# Bugs
If you find a bug [report it here](https://github.com/pfz4/oxidized-tscript/issues).
